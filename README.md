# In this project I've built a simple chatbot for the cafes so that customers can order customized drinks in advance.
This mini-project is completely based on Python. In this project, I’ve created a café chatbot that can help cut the wait-time by taking customers’ orders in advance. You can deploy this chatbot on the café’s website/app using its source code and it’ll work just fine. It’ll ask customers ‘What type of drink you would like to order?’, ‘What size of drink you would like?’, ‘Did you bring your cup or would you like a plastic cup?’. By selecting options from these questions asked by the bot, customers can order on the café’s website using this chat-bot thus making the process easy and time-saving.
